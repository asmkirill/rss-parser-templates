# rss-parser-templates

This is the RSS parser, where different blocks are provided that make up the parser and explained some examples of how it can be used. 
Note that the complete working code for this parser will not be providing as it is a part of a highly graded task in a real student course.

Task is to parse the RSS URL and provide two formatted outputs: JSON and the CONSOLE output.

The "limit" variable specifies the maximum number of news blocks that will be printed.
If the "limit" is not specified, then the user should get all available feeds.
If the "limit" is larger than the feed size, then the user should get all available news.

For console output, the desired order is to display the channel elements first, followed by the items. 
A space should be added between the channel and item blocks. 
When displaying an item, the description should be on a new line and separated by a space from the other item elements.
